# MegaDriveBreakout
Breaskout for the Sega Megadrive / Genesis. Built with **SGDK**

Just a simple implementation of Breakout to learn some SGDK.

Groundwork laid by OhSat over at [their Blog](https://www.ohsat.com/tutorial/megapong/megapong-1/)

Collision detection could probably lighter.

Runs on real hardware at 60fps

Sounds and graphics are all mine. Chill music is from Streets of Rage.
